There are two folders (as per the format specified (in the contest) to us for submission):
  -> train (contains images for training the classifier)
      -> 10 folders namely: i, ii, ....ix, x.
      -> each of them contains hundreds of curated images of the specific 
         digit that they are named after. 
  -> val  (contains images for testing the classifier)
      -> 10 folders namely: i, ii, ....ix, x.
      -> each of them contains hundreds of curated images of the specific 
         digit that they are named after.
  The train-test ration is maintained at 9:1 (approx).
