There are two folders (as per the format specified (in the contest) to us for submission):        

  &emsp; -> train (contains images for training the classifier)  
      &emsp;&emsp; -> 10 folders namely: i, ii, ....ix, x.         
      &emsp;&emsp; -> each of them contains hundreds of curated images of the specific         
      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; digit that they are named after.  
         
  &emsp; -> val  (contains images for testing the classifier)      
  &emsp;&emsp; -> 10 folders namely: i, ii, ....ix, x.
  &emsp;&emsp; -> each of them contains hundreds of curated images of the specific    
  &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; digit that they are named after.      
  * The train-test ration is maintained at 9:1 (approx).
